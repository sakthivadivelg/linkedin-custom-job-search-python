Files to Add (Post-Creation)
Once you click Create repository, you should upload three main files to make the project complete:

scraper.py: The actual Python code we discussed (using the li_at cookie).

requirements.txt: A list of the libraries needed to run your code. It should contain:

Plaintext
selenium
webdriver-manager
README.md: A guide on how to use it. You should include:

How to find the li_at cookie.

How to install the requirements.

How to run the script.

4. Visibility & License
Visibility: Keep it Public if you want to show this off in your portfolio.

Add .gitignore: Select the Python template. This prevents "junk" files (like __pycache__) from being uploaded to GitHub.

Add license: I recommend the MIT License. It’s a standard, simple license that allows others to use your code while protecting you from liability.
